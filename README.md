# JavaWeekdayConverter

**Author:** Python Developer exploring Java

## Project Overview

**JavaWeekdayConverter** is a basic Java application that converts numeric day inputs (1-7) into the respective day of the week. Originally developed to improve my understanding of Java fundamentals, this project demonstrates my learning journey in a language outside my primary expertise in Python. This is my second Java project, designed to build foundational knowledge in handling user input, control structures, and error handling in a structured, practical context.

## Features

- Maps numerical input (1-7) to weekday names.
- Validates user input, providing clear error messages for entries outside the expected range.
- Simple console-based interaction for efficient testing and user feedback.

## Usage

1. Run the program from the console.
2. Enter a number between 1 and 7 to see the corresponding day of the week.
3. If an invalid number is entered, a friendly error message will guide the user to try again.

## Why I Created This Project

As a Python developer, I’m eager to expand my skill set to Java. This project is a stepping stone, designed to showcase my adaptability, attention to detail, and commitment to continuous learning—qualities essential to any software development role. This exercise not only enhances my coding versatility but also demonstrates my approach to mastering new programming languages.
